Zeniq's Website
I finished the basics now I have to wait for Jack to tell me what to change what to add what to not...
After that I will fix some issues and make the website even responsive 

Utils using : Bootstrap 5 - HTML - CSS 
Later : Php - JavaScript(ReactJs)

Later I will change the columns from 8 columns to 3 x 2 
3 Normal columns, 2 Horizontal columns to make the service's section more professional and clear for the user 
After that I will change the font to something better.
   -- Finishing the contact us section so the company owner can receive infos.
   -- After the owner will be satisfied for the website I will try to learn back end even more so I can switch his web from 
   static web to Dynamic website [ Customers can order from web ]
